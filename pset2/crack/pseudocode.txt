verify that program was run with correct argument
split the hash to salt and encrypted parts
create a pointer to a string which contains all the characters
get amount of characters
get a salt
for each value from 1 to max_password_length
    enumerate all possible matches, recursively invoking a function
    in the end case(last character incremented)
        create a hash from a guess
        compare this hash with a given one
        if a match is found
            print a result out
            return true from a function
continue until a match will be found
if match was not found print out "No match was found"
